<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PE-RT Oxygen Barrier Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PE-RT Ⅰ</li><li>PE-RT Ⅱ</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PE-RT Oxygen Barrier Pipes are classified into two types: PE-RT Ⅰ and PE-RT Ⅱ. PE-RT Ⅰ pipes are made using a single reactor technology, which results in a higher degree of cross-linking and better resistance to high temperatures and pressure. On the other hand, PE-RT Ⅱ pipes are produced using a multiple reactor technology, offering a more flexible material suitable for applications requiring increased flexibility and impact resistance. Both types of pipes feature an oxygen barrier layer, making them suitable for radiant heating and cooling systems.</p></p>
