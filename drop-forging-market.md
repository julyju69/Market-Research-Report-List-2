<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drop Forging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Die Drop Forging</li><li>Closed Die Drop Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drop forging is a metalworking process where a heated metal blank is placed into a die and then struck with a hammer or press to form it into a desired shape. The two main types of drop forging markets are open die drop forging and closed die drop forging. In open die drop forging, the metal is shaped between two flat or slightly shaped dies, creating a more flexible and versatile process. In closed die drop forging, the metal is shaped within a closed cavity, resulting in more precise and complex shapes.</p></p>
