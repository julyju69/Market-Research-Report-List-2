<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sintering Paste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Sintering</li><li>Pressure-less Sintering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sintering paste market can be broadly categorized into two types: pressure sintering and pressure-less sintering. Pressure sintering involves applying external pressure to the material during the sintering process, resulting in higher density and improved mechanical properties. On the other hand, pressure-less sintering does not require external pressure, and instead relies on factors like temperature and time to achieve sintering. Both types of sintering have their own advantages and applications depending on the specific requirements of the material being processed.</p></p>
