<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Foil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Copper Foil</li><li>Electrolytic Copper Foil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper foil market includes two main types: rolled copper foil and electrolytic copper foil. Rolled copper foil is produced by passing a slab of copper through a pair of rolling mills which reduces thickness and creates a uniform foil. Electrolytic copper foil is made by electrolysis process which deposits copper onto a titanium drum. Both types of copper foil have unique properties and applications, with rolled copper foil being more flexible and easier to handle, while electrolytic copper foil is known for its high purity and conductivity.</p></p>
