<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Sealed Lead-acid Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AGM Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Car sealed lead-acid batteries are available in two main types: AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) batteries and Gel batteries. AGM batteries have a fiberglass mat that absorbs sulfuric acid electrolyte, providing better resistance to vibration and allowing for a faster recharge. Gel batteries use a gelified electrolyte, which enhances their resistance to deep discharges and extreme temperatures. Both types are maintenance-free and widely used in automotive applications, providing reliable power for vehicles.</p></p>
