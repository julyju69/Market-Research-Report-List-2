<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Rooftop Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid Type</li><li>Off- Grid Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar rooftop market can be categorized into two main types - On-Grid Type and Off-Grid Type. On-Grid Type systems are connected to the main power grid and allow users to sell excess electricity back to the grid. This type is common in urban areas where grid connectivity is strong. Off-Grid Type systems, on the other hand, are independent of the main grid and store excess energy in batteries for later use. This type is popular in rural or remote areas where grid connectivity is poor.</p></p>
