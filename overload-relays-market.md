<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overload Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Overload Relay</li><li>Electronic Overload Relays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Overload relays are devices used to protect electrical circuits from overcurrent situations. There are two main types of overload relays on the market: thermal overload relays and electronic overload relays. </p><p>Thermal overload relays use a bimetal strip that heats up when current exceeds a certain level, causing the relay to trip and interrupt the circuit. Electronic overload relays use solid-state components to sense current levels and trip the relay when necessary. Both types provide crucial protection for electrical systems from overheating and potential damage.</p></p>
