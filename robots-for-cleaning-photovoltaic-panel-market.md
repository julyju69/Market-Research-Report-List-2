<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Robots for Cleaning Photovoltaic Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trackless</li><li>Railed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trackless robots for cleaning photovoltaic panels are autonomous machines that move freely across the surface of the panels without the need for any physical tracks or guide rails. They are able to navigate obstacles and clean the panels efficiently. On the other hand, railed robots for cleaning photovoltaic panels are guided by fixed rails or tracks along the edges of the panels. They are limited to moving within the constraints of the rails but can provide a more precise and controlled cleaning process.</p></p>
