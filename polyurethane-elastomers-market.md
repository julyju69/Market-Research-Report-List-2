<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Elastomers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Elastomers</li><li>Thermosetting Elastomers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane elastomers are a type of polymer material that exhibits elasticity, flexibility, and resistance to abrasion. They can be classified into two main types based on their response to heat: thermoplastic elastomers and thermosetting elastomers. Thermoplastic elastomers can be melted and reformed multiple times, while thermosetting elastomers undergo a permanent chemical change when heated, becoming rigid and non-reversible. Both types of polyurethane elastomers have unique properties and applications in industries such as automotive, construction, and footwear.</p></p>
