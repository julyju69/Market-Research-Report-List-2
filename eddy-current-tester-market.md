<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eddy Current Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Tester</li><li>Non-contact Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Eddy current testers can be divided into two main market types: contact testers and non-contact testers. Contact testers require physical contact with the sample being tested, usually through a probe or sensor. Non-contact testers, on the other hand, utilize electromagnetic induction to detect defects or inconsistencies in the material without the need for direct contact. Both types of testers are commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and electronics for quality control and inspection purposes.</p></p>
