<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Frequency Sound-Absorbing Insulation Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-cell Foams</li><li>Open-cell Foams</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low-frequency sound-absorbing insulation materials are divided into two main market types: closed-cell foams and open-cell foams. Closed-cell foams have tightly packed cells that prevent the passage of air and sound waves, making them more effective at blocking low-frequency noise. Open-cell foams, on the other hand, have interconnected cells that allow sound waves to pass through, but they also absorb and dissipate the sound energy. Both types of insulation materials are commonly used in construction and industrial applications to reduce noise transmission and improve acoustics.</p></p>
