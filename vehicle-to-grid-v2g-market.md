<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional V2G</li><li>Bidirectional V2G</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology allows electric vehicles to interact with the power grid. Unidirectional V2G enables vehicles to feed excess energy back into the grid, helping to stabilize supply and demand. Bidirectional V2G goes a step further by allowing vehicles to both draw energy from the grid and feed energy back into it. This flexibility can help balance the grid during peak demand times and reduce the strain on power plants. Both types of V2G markets offer opportunities for consumers to save money on energy costs and support the integration of renewable energy sources.</p></p>
