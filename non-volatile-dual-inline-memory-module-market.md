<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Volatile Dual In–Line Memory Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nvdimm-N</li><li>Nvdimm-F</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-Volatile Dual In–Line Memory Modules (NVDIMMs) come in two main types: NVDIMM-N and NVDIMM-F. NVDIMM-N operates as a cost-effective solution by using system power to transfer data stored in DRAM to flash memory during a power loss event. On the other hand, NVDIMM-F integrates NAND flash directly onto the module, providing a high-capacity, non-volatile storage option for applications requiring persistent memory. Both types offer a reliable solution for retaining data during unexpected power outages or system failures in enterprise environments.</p></p>
