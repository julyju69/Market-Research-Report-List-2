<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Rhythm Management Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICDs</li><li>CRT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable Cardiac Rhythm Management Devices are medical devices used to manage and control abnormal heart rhythms. These devices can be divided into three main types: Pacemakers, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices. Pacemakers regulate the heart rate by sending electrical impulses to the heart muscles. ICDs monitor the heart rhythm and deliver a shock to restore normal rhythm if needed. CRT devices coordinate the contractions of the heart chambers to improve overall heart function.</p></p>
