<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static-volume Display</li><li>Swept-volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volumetric display devices are divided into two main types - Static-volume Display and Swept-volume Display. Static-volume displays create 3D images by illuminating a volume of space with voxels that remain stationary. Swept-volume displays use rotating or oscillating mirrors to sweep a 2D image through a volume of space to create the illusion of a 3D image. Both types of displays have their own unique advantages and applications in fields such as medical imaging, gaming, and education.</p></p>
